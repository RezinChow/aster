# Aster

Aster is one Rust workspace for the terminal coding tool, harness, and Work desktop host.

- Build from the repository root with the pinned Rust toolchain.
- `apps/aster` is the `aster` terminal binary. `crates/code/acp` is its
  `a3s-code-acp` companion. Build and distribute both together.
- `crates/code/core` is the embeddable Rust SDK and harness. Do not add
  Node, Python, or Go bindings, SDKs, or package publishing jobs.
- `apps/work/src-tauri` builds Work from this workspace; build ACP and Office
  first with `just build-work`. Keep its frontend under `apps/work` and do not
  add a second Cargo workspace or lockfile.
- All members have `publish = false`; A3S dependencies, including optional
  ones, must resolve locally. `tests/workspace_dependencies.py` guards this.
- Keep internal A3S dependencies local. Preserve the upstream package names
  and public Rust APIs unless a task explicitly requires renaming them.
- Configuration stays ACL, parsed by `a3s-acl`. Preserve host/workspace
  trust boundaries, sandbox enforcement, bounded reads, and error handling.
- `crates/terminal` preserves the upstream pager layout and license notices.
- Use `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, focused tests, and the workspace checks
  in CI. Test new behavior with small hermetic cases.
- Do not restore upstream binary updates for Aster. Updates must not replace
  this product with an A3S/Grok release.
- Migration history and source provenance live in `docs/migration.md` and
  `docs/source-manifest.json`. Never copy credentials or user session state.
